You can get these values from your Vercel KV database settings (only these two variables are required).

## How to Use

### For Admin (You)

1. Go to `/setup-secret-santa`
2. Enter participant names (must be an even number)
3. Set a budget message
4. Click "Generate Secret Santa Links"
5. Copy and share each unique link with the corresponding participant

## Important Notes

- ✅ All KV keys are prefixed with `secretsanta:` to avoid conflicts with other projects
- ✅ Participants can only reveal once (subsequent visits show the same assignment)
- ✅ Assignments are made dynamically as people reveal, ensuring fair distribution
- ✅ The app ensures no one gets assigned to themselves (with even number of participants)
- ⚠️ Currently supports one active Secret Santa event at a time
- ⚠️ Save the generated links - they cannot be retrieved later!

## KV Data Structure

All keys use the prefix `secretsanta:` to avoid conflicts.

### Event Data
- **Key:** `secretsanta:event`
- **Value:**
  ```typescript
  {
    participants: Participant[],
    budgetMessage: string,
    createdAt: number
  }
  ```

### Participant Data
- **Key:** `secretsanta:participant:{id}`
- **Value:**
  ```typescript
  {
    id: string,
    name: string,
    hasRevealed: boolean,
    assignedTo: string | null
  }
  ```

## Resetting the Event

If you need to create a new event, the app currently overwrites the existing event. For production use, you might want to add a way to delete old events or support multiple events.

You can manually delete KV data through the Vercel dashboard if needed.
